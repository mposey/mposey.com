Hi! My name is Marcus, and Iâ€™m a freshman at Cornell University studying computer science. On this blog you'll find occasional musings on software development, systems, machine learning, and whatever else comes to mind.

Feel free to reach out to me at [**mep296@cornell.edu**](mailto:mep296@cornell.edu)!
